Hi! I'm Basil K Joseph and I'm learning the fundamentals of C++ programming with The Cherno's YouTube channel. This repository contains the code snippets and exercises I wrote while practicing different concepts.
This repository includes code examples covering various C++ basics like variables, data types, operators, control flow statements (if-else, loops), functions, classes, and pointers, and so on. 
The code files are currently in one folder. Each filename tries to describe the concept it practices (e.g: class.cpp, pointerscpp ).

This code might not represent complete projects, but rather practice exercises for each concept. I'm still learning and aim to build more complex applications in the future.
